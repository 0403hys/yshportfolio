            Hi. My name is Yoseop Han and I'm currently a student in USA enrolling in 8th grade. Since I was first
            introduced to a job occupation like computer science in 2015, I was mesmerized by how I could change the
            world with the infinate potential this field possesses. My intrigue first ignited when I was playing this video
            game called "Minecraft". I enjoyed playing this game everyday and I watched almost every videos uploaded to
            Youtube about it. I even joined a minecraft community and chatted there everyday. I got new friends in that server,
            and it was one of my best memories during my childhood. One day, I was playing in the server and someone was
            banned from the server for advertising other minecraft community in the game. Act of advertisement was prohibited
            in my community because that might cause the decrease in the members of the server. However, I wondered what
            if I made my own minecraft server to play with my online friends. So I searched up on the internet on how to 
            create a minecraft server. It was a difficult task for my head to process at the moment, but by reading and watching
            tutorials public on the internet I was finally able to have my own minecraft server file running on my computer.
            The accomplishment I felt when that black console showed up on my laptop can never be forgotten. The texts/commands
            I saw on the console was reminding me of those hackers in the movie and I thought it was very awesome. After, that
            I ran my own server and started to promote my server online. Then, I realized the importance of website in running
            my own community, so I searched up how to make a website. When I first accessed the tutorials regarding web development,
            It was a whole new field and I was afraid to join in. I watched many Youtube videos but I couldn't understand the concept.
            Therefore, I was overwhelmed and computer science faded in my head few days later. However, computer sceince came back
            into my mind when my brother decided to join computer science major in the university of Arizona. He bought a book
            about it and the book inspired my imagination in computer science once again. I started reading through the book when
            my brother wasn't using it, and I met a whole new world outside of web development. Afterward, I made my mind up to
            become a software engineer and I started to put my feet on every fields of computer science to find a field that best
            fit me. Knowledge I learned from here were valuable and precious than any other things. My persepctive of the entire
            modern technology changed and I opened my eyes to how the world is currently progressing. And now, I'm here to relearn
            web development. I think this field is very crucial in understanding the trends of developing, so I returned to the field
            where this entire journey started. I'm very excited to introduce you my contribution to the web. Thank you.
